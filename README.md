Subject: Request for collaboration

Dear Research Engineering Group, I am reaching out for scoping a potential collaboration. Social inequalities in health have been described across a range of European countries. While it is well-known in the literature that the higher the social class, the lower the prevalence/incidence of health problems, no study has attempted to explain social inequalities in health for Europe as a whole. To address this, I am setting up a project proposal for a large-scale study using promptly available data (European Quality of Life Time Series, freely available online) and deep learning techniques. I envision a 2-year project answering the call “Personal Stories, Healing Nations” employing 1 full-time Post-Doctoral researcher covering the social science parts of the study and (potentially) in collaboration with your team for the technological parts. We are hoping to submit by Dec 1st, so we would be keen to establish the costs for this digital component by Nov 28.

While I am fairly new to big-data (and, I have to admit, I have my reservations), I believe a well-designed project with these sources might be able to rewrite our understanding of social inequalities in health in Europe (and even beyond) during the last two decaces, a period involving a series of major socio-economical and political events, ça va sans dire. Its impact will be relevant for the general public and could potentially even suggest actions to governments.

Your Sincerely,

Professor J. Doe
